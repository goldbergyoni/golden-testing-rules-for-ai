# Reliable AI Testing

## Wait, what

_‚è∞ Draft, writing this now during October 2024_

This repo will contain LLM-optimized guides on how to produce great tests. Overall, this will bring two genuine values:

1. Maintainable tests - _Products tests right_ with best practices inside
2. Exhaustive tests - _Produce the right tests._ Cover all the dark scenarios of your application, let teach AI how to product the right tests


TBD, stay tuned, [follow my newsletter](https://testjavascript.com/newsletter/)

## Workflow

Point your preferred LLM toward one of the specs here and ask it to conclude these best practices and approaches while generating tests
