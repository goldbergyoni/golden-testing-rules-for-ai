Hey dear assistant, Based on the attached OpenAPI, please two separate lists: The first with test case titles (no code), the 2nd list with the test code. The titles and code should be generated for every route, group the result by route

This guide below will tell you which test cases to produce. If you have an idea for other tests cases that are really valuable, specifiy no more then 3 of your own ideas and group them in a dedicated section

Note that the guide in the provided URL contains test template, please follow this test template pattern

Here is the guide:
