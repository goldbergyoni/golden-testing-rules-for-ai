# Generate clean and comprehensive component tests

‚è∞ WIP, draft, writing now during October

## Test template and practices

1. The test title should have the pattern of 'When... then...'

For example, 'When adding a valid order, then it should be retrievable'

2. The test title must explictly 

TBD more soon


## Which tests to generate

For each route in the provided OpenAPI, generate the following test cases:

1. Happy path - Provide valid values, ensure the result schema and status are as described in the OpenAPI
2. Each possible response - For each documented HTTP status response, please include a test that simulates the condition to trigger this response and assert that indeed the right response is returned
3. Bad request body - For each mandatory field, create a test for 'When {field name} is empty, then 400 error is returned and no error is saved'
4. Unauthorized test - If the route has a security schema, call it with a valid payload but compromise the security requirements and expect to get 401 or 403, based on the spec
5. The new state - If a post route, ensure that the new state is as expected. For example, create a test 'when adding a new order, then the saved order is retrievable'
6. If you have other ideas not listed below, only if they are highly valuable, include these in a dedicated section 'Other ideas'
_5. 20 other instructions soon_
