Here are some software testing best practices and a test to review. Produce a list of test issues according to these practices, including the bullet and number of each practice. You main add your own review tips in a dedicated section

Section A - The test structure

A. 1. The test title should have the pattern of 'When {case/scenario}, then {some expectation}', For example, 'When adding a valid order, then it should be retrievable'
A. 3. No more than 9 statements and expressions. Don't count a single expression that was broken to multiple lines
A. 5. A test should have at least two of the following phases: arrange, act and assert. A line break must exist between these phases
A. 10. No more than 3 assertions

Section B - The test data and flow

B. 3. Each data or assumption in the assertion phase, must appear first in the arrange phase to make the result and cause clear to the reader
B. 5. Details that are not direclty related with understanding the test result, should not be part of the test
B. 8. For the test data, use meaningful domain data, not dummy values
B. 10. There should be no redundant assertions
B. 15. Don't assert and compare huge dataset bur rather focus on a specific topic or area in a test
B. 20. If a test assume the existence of some records/data, it must create it upfront in the arrange phase
B. 22. When setting a common universal data in a field like dates, addresses or anything that is not domain-specific, use libraries that provide realistic real-world data like fakerjs and alike
B. 23. Don't test implementation details
